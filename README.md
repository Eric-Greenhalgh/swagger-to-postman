# Swagger to Postman Converter

This project is a React-based web application that facilitates the conversion of Swagger API documentation into a Postman collection format.

# Planned Modifications

- [ ] Add option to include a pre-defined prescript
- [ ] Fix some responsiveness issues with long endpoint names wrapping onto a new line in slightly smaller windows
- [ ] Rather than just copying to the clipboard, implement logic to create a file that will be saved to the computer, bypassing the need to complete this step manually

# Features

- Paste from Clipboard: Users can easily paste their Swagger JSON directly into the provided input.
- Select Endpoints: After parsing the Swagger JSON, users can select which specific endpoints they want to include in the Postman collection.
- Error Notifications: The application provides visual feedback in the form of notifications for any errors encountered, such as invalid JSON format.
- Postman Collection Output: Once the conversion is done, the resulting Postman collection is displayed, allowing users to review it before use.
- Copy to Clipboard: With a single click, users can copy the generated Postman collection to their clipboard, ready to be imported into Postman.
